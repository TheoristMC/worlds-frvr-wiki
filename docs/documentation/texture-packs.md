# Texture Packs

In **Worlds FRVR**, you can create and customize your own textures to change the look and feel of blocks, props, and other game elements. This guide will walk you through downloading, modifying, and testing texture packs.

## Getting the files

Download the latest set of textures listed below:

### Voxel

- This is the main texture applied to blocks and props in the game.

### Voxel Normal

- This is a normal map that adds depth and detail to flat textures.
- It helps simulate small bumps, grooves, and lighting effects without adding extra 3D geometry.

### Voxel Mask

- Red channel: Adjusts how much tint (color variation) is applied.
- Green channel: Controls whether a texture is unlit or emissive (glows in the dark).
- Blue channel: Defines the specular mask, affecting shininess or reflectiveness.
